# Hotel Check-In/Out Workflow Implementation

## Booking Status Flow

### Status Definitions
- `pending`: Booking created, awaiting confirmation
- `confirmed`: Booking confirmed, ready for check-in
- `checked_in`: Guest has checked in, room is occupied
- `cancelled`: Booking was cancelled
- `completed`: Guest has checked out, booking finished
- `no_show`: Guest did not arrive

## Check-In Process

### Requirements
- Booking status must be `confirmed`
- Check-in date must be today or in the past
- Staff validation: ID verified, payment confirmed

### Workflow
1. **Staff accesses check-in list** (`Staff\CheckInController@index`)
   - Shows bookings with status `confirmed` for today
   - Only confirmed bookings are eligible

2. **Staff processes check-in** (`Staff\CheckInController@process`)
   - Updates booking status: `confirmed` → `checked_in`
   - Updates room status: `available`/`reserved` → `onboard`
   - Creates room status history record
   - Records check-in notes if provided

## Check-Out Process

### Requirements
- Booking status must be `checked_in`
- Room status must be `onboard`

### Workflow
1. **Staff accesses check-out list** (`Staff\CheckOutController@index`)
   - Shows all bookings where room status is `onboard`
   - No date restriction (shows all current guests)

2. **Staff processes check-out** (`Staff\CheckOutController@process`)
   - Updates booking status: `checked_in` → `completed`
   - Updates room status based on condition:
     - Good condition → `available`
     - Needs cleaning → `reserved`
     - Needs maintenance → `closed`
   - Creates room status history record
   - Records damages/notes if provided

## Room Status Management

### Staff Restrictions
- Staff can only update room status for rooms with status `available` or `closed`
- Rooms with status `reserved` or `onboard` are handled via check-in/out process
- Edit button disabled for `reserved`/`onboard` rooms in room management

### Room Status Meanings
- `available`: Ready for new bookings
- `reserved`: Future booking exists or needs cleaning
- `onboard`: Currently occupied by guest
- `closed`: Out of service/maintenance

## User Cancellation Rules
- Users can only cancel bookings with status `confirmed`
- Cannot cancel if check-in date has passed
- Cannot cancel `checked_in` or `completed` bookings

## Validation & Availability
- Room availability checks include both `confirmed` and `checked_in` bookings
- Booking conflicts prevent double-booking
- Real-time validation during booking process

## Database Changes
- Added `checked_in` status to bookings enum
- Updated all controllers to use new workflow
- Updated seeders to create realistic test data

## Benefits of This Workflow
1. **Clear Status Tracking**: Distinct status for each booking phase
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Room status reflects actual occupancy
3. **Staff Workflow**: Logical separation of check-in/out processes
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of room status changes
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Accurate availability checking
6. **User Experience**: Clear booking status for guests

## Files Updated
- Migration: Added `checked_in` status to bookings
- Controllers: `CheckInController`, `CheckOutController`
- Views: Room management restrictions
- Models: Booking status validation
- Seeders: Realistic test data

This implementation ensures a complete and logical workflow for hotel operations while maintaining data integrity and providing clear audit trails.
